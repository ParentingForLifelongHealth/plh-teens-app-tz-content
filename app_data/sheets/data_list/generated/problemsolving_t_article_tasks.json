We then look for the negatives and positives of each solution, and we agree “okay let’s try this one.”\n\nMy friends even took it to their own homes, and it is helping with their families as well!\n\nIt is great when others listen to you and accept your ideas even though you are young. We can all bring that harmony with our friends and family.",
